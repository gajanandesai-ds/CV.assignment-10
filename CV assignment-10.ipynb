This allows the filter to cover a larger area of the input image and capture more information. The filter is also given a “dilation factor” which increases the size of the filter so that it can capture more information from the input image. The dilation factor is usually defined as the ratio between the stride and the filter size. This means that the filter will “see” more of the input image and thus be able to capture more information. This is especially useful for image segmentation and object detection tasks."

Transposed convolution works by first calculating the output size of the operation and then computing the weights of the operation. The output is then computed by taking the dot product of the weights and the input. By reversing the forward convolution process, transposed convolution can be used to increase the size of an image."

This approach is used to reduce the computational cost of convolutions. Separable convolutions can also be used to reduce the number of parameters in a model, resulting in a simpler and more efficient model. Separable convolutions are especially useful for deep learning models where the number of parameters can quickly become unmanageable."
